# Secret Contract Verifier

## Background

Provably fair and open source software is a key value proposition for web3 architecture. On Ethereum, it is easy to use an explorer tool to look at code executing on the blockchain. Code that runs in a Cosmos SDK chain is compiled to cosmwasm which is not very human readable. In order to easily verify Secret Contract Code you can now use this tool which will compare the hash of a compiled contract to that which is found on the mainnet chain. Hence, you can rest assured that the code you are referencing is indeed the code running on-chain.
